# Mine and Rock Detection Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning solution for detecting mines vs rocks using SONAR data. The system uses various ML algorithms to classify underwater objects based on SONAR signal characteristics.

## Project Overview

The project analyzes SONAR data to distinguish between:
- **Mines**: Underwater explosive devices
- **Rocks**: Natural underwater formations

## Files

- `SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete ML analysis and implementation
- `SonarData.csv`: Dataset containing SONAR signal data for training and testing the models

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Multiple ML algorithm implementations
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of results
- Performance metrics analysis

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning Libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
- Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment
3. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed
4. Run the notebook cells to execute the analysis

## Dataset

The `SonarData.csv` file contains SONAR signal data with features representing different frequency bands and a target variable indicating whether the object is a mine or rock.

## Results

The notebook includes comprehensive analysis of different ML algorithms and their performance in classifying SONAR signals for mine detection.
